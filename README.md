# impergonate


This tool uses the impersonalization of Windows tokens to run commands as another user and also to have an interactive shell. Some options also allow you to request a certificate in the name of the impersonated profile to be able to reuse the identity elsewhere on the network using the generated certificate to authenticate yourself. The certificate will be stored in `C:/Windows/Temp` after generation
